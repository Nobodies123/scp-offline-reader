Add SCP offline reader app

This commit adds the initial code for an SCP offline reader app. The app uses the Kivy framework to create a simple browser interface. It includes features such as a toolbar with navigation buttons, a text input for entering URLs, and a WebView for displaying web content. The app also connects to a SQLite database to cache web content and allows users to go back, go forward, and return to the home page. The commit also includes a custom WebViewClient class for handling page loading and caching logic.
